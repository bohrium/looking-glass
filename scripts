initialize a blank canvas Z   
sample a nonempty subset RR of rows of Z
sample a subset CC of columns of Z
for each R in RR
    sample a pair ctrue, cfalse of distinct colors
    for each column C
       paint Z at (R,C) with ctrue if C is in CC else cfalse
copy Y from Z
copy X from Z
erase the rectangle (min RR+1, min CC+1), (H, W) from X

1
initialize a blank canvas X of shape (>=13) by (>=13)
initialize a blank canvas Y of shape 9 by 9
fill Y with gray
for each king direction (dR, dC):
    sample a color c
    let P be the 3x3 plus sign of color c
    initialize a 3x3 sprite S 
    fill S with gray
    locate the cell (r, c) of S (dR, dC) away from S's center
    paint P with its center on (r,c) onto S, clipping at borders
    paint P onto the (3dR, 3dC) cell from Y's center
    pack and paint P onto X

2
initialize a blank canvas X of shape 3 by 3
initialize a blank canvas Y of shape 3 by 3
paint X with random colors
fill Y with the majority color

3 
initialize a blank canvas Z
copy Y from Z
copy X from Z
sample a few positions PP in Z's grid such that 5x5 sprites therein centered do not overlap or overflow 
sample distinct colors corth, cdiag
let P be the 3x3 plus sign of color corth
paint P's center pixel with cdiag
let S by the 5x5 plus sign of color corth
paint S with the 5x5 times sign of color cdiag
for each PP 
    paint P at PP onto X
    paint S at PP onto Y

4 
initialize a blank canvas Z
sample a cell PP of Z
initialize pen at cell PP of Z
repeat until hit border
    drag up by 2 with color gray
    drag right 2 with color gray
initialize pen at cell PP of Z
repeat until hit border
    drag down by 2 with color gray
    drag left 2 with color gray
paint the cell PP of Z with cyan
copy Y from Z
copy X from Z
erase all gray cells from X

5 
initialize a blank canvas Z 
sample a rectangle from Z of shape at least 3 by 3
draw rectangle's border onto Z in gray
draw rectangle's interior onto Z in cyan
sample an ortho direction DD
sample a cell PP of the rectangle's DD side that is not a corner
initialize pen at cell PP of Z
repeat until hit border
    drag in direction DD with color cyan   
copy Y from Z
copy X from Z
erase all cyan cells from X

6
initialize a blank canvas X of shape 3 by 3
initialize a blank canvas Y of shape 3 by 3
paint X with random colors
for each row R of X
    if row R of X is monochromatic
        paint row R of Y with gray

7
initialize a blank canvas X
initialize a blank canvas Y of same shape
sample a few shapes with unique shape of minimal volume
for each shape S
    pack S onto X with color cyan
    pack S onto Y with color blue if nonminimal else red

8
initialize a blank canvas X
sample a few blocks, each monochromatic, with well-defined plurality
for each block B
    pack B onto X
set Y to the plurality block

9 
initialize a blank canvas X
initialize a blank canvas Y of same shape
sample a subset S of king directions
to each direction in S associate two colors so that all are distinct
for each direction-color (D, c, cc) triple
    paint the D corner of X with C
copy Y from X
sample a color cc distinct from any previous one
until no change in Y
    for each direction-color (D, c, cc) triple
        surround colors c with color cc on Y 
        (if overwrite happened, erase cell)
    for each direction-color (D, cc, c) triple
        surround colors cc with color c on Y
        (if overwrite happened, erase cell)
for each direction-color (D, cc, c) triple
    erase color cc from Y
